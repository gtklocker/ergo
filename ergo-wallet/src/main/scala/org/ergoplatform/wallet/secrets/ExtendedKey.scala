/** Description from https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki :
  *
  * We extend both private and public keys first with an extra 256 bits of entropy.
  * This extension, called the chain code, is identical for corresponding private and public keys
  * and consists of 32 bytes.
  * We represent an extended private key as (k, c), with k the normal private key,
  * and c the chain code. An extended public key is represented as (K, c),
  * with K = point(k) and c the chain code.
  *
  * Each extended key has 2^31 normal child keys, and 2^31 hardened child keys.
  * Each of these child keys has an index. The normal child keys use indices 0 through 2^31-1.
  * The hardened child keys use indices 2^31 through `2^32-1`.

    * public keys.
